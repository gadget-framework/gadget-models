Different attempts to mymic a decrease in consumption of other and herring as seal grow. Because both other and herring are modelled as *otherfood* they are preys with homogeneous size distribution, which means we need to deal mainly with predator size - prey preferences here (not prey size).
Based on experience with Baltic cod we could adapt the parameters from exponential suitability:

```
  if (coeff[0] < 0.0 && coeff[1] < 0.0)
    check = coeff[3] / (1.0 + exp(-(coeff[0] - (coeff[1] * preyLength) + (coeff[2] * predLength))));
  else if (coeff[0] > 0.0 && coeff[1] > 0.0)
    check = coeff[3] / (1.0 + exp(-(-coeff[0] + (coeff[1] * preyLength) + (coeff[2] * predLength))));
  else
    check = coeff[3] / (1.0 + exp(-(coeff[0] + (coeff[1] * preyLength) + (coeff[2] * predLength))));
```

Biomass of herring is roughly 10-100 times larger than the biomass of vendace in the model, but the contribution in weight in the stomachs is comparable. This means that availability of herring and/or preference are much lower than vendace to the ringed seal.

Other makes the rest 10-25% of the diet in weight. Abundance and preference should be set to match the observed % in the diet


ven-rin01 accumulation of rinmat in the first lengths after maturation (L50 pretty high) or movement (140 cm) (problem likely from ringed_seal_07). The reason is that M drops from 0.12 to 0.05 passing from rinimm to rinmat. It's relevant because it screw the length distribution in the population which is crucial to estimate consumption. How to reconcile?
 - progressive change in M at least in those ages overlapping the two groups (age4-5)? For instance:
   	        (/ (+ #rinimm.M #rinmat.M) 2)

ven-rin02 from ven-rin01, it implements (/ (+ #rinimm.M #rinmat.M) 2) which makes sense but doesn't solve the issue on the length distr of seal.
